      <h1> The Effect of Climate change </h1>

        <div> Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers
          have shrunk,ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier,plant and animal ranges have
          shifted and trees are flowering sooner.

          Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate Change
          are now occuring:loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
      </div>
      <h2> Future Effects </h2>
       <ol>
         <li> Temperature will continue to rise. </li>
         <li> Frost-free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen. </li>
         <li> Changes in Precipitation Patterns. </li>
          <li> More Droughts and Heat Waves. </li>
          <li> Hurricanes will becomestronger and more intense. </li>
           <li> Sea level will rise 1-4 feet by 2100 </li>
           <li> Arctic likely become ice free </li>
