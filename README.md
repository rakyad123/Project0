# Project0
I have made a project on Climate change.
Here are details:
In my first file "introduction.html" I have introduced myself and I used hyperlinks,unordered list and CSS properties, #id and .class selector and @media. 
In first link "Climate Change in an ordered list." It will take to another link where I have made an ordered list and file name
is "orderlist.html".
In second link "Scienticfic consensus on Climate change in Table Format." I have used table format and the file name is "table.html"
In third link "Images of Climate Change." I have used CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector and file name is "image.html".
in fourth link "Global Warming Solutions." I have used Bootstrap component and file name is "bootstrap.html".
In fifth link "Conclusion." I have used Bootstrapâ€™s grid model, placeholder and button.
I have made a file "stylesheet.css" which I have used in my all files.
I have used CSS properties and selectors in different files.
 
 Thanks,
 Rakhi
